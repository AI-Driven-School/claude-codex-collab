# AI Delegation Rules

This project uses 3-AI collaborative development (Claude + Codex + Gemini).

## When to Delegate

### Delegate to Codex (Implementation)
- New file creation (3+ files)
- Large refactoring (10+ files)
- Test generation
- Boilerplate code generation

Command: `bash scripts/delegate.sh codex implement "<task>"`

### Delegate to Gemini (Research)
- Multi-source research
- Technology comparisons
- Trend analysis
- Large codebase analysis (1M token context)

Command: `bash scripts/delegate.sh gemini research "<query>"`

### Keep in Claude (Design & Review)
- Architecture decisions
- Requirements writing
- Code review
- Small edits (< 5 lines)
- Security-sensitive code

## Design Documents

Always check for existing design docs before implementing:
- `docs/requirements/` - Requirements definitions
- `docs/specs/` - UI specifications
- `docs/api/` - API designs

## Workflow

1. Write requirements with Claude → `docs/requirements/`
2. Design API with Claude → `docs/api/`
3. Delegate implementation to Codex → `src/`
4. Delegate tests to Codex → `tests/`
5. Review with Claude → `docs/reviews/`
